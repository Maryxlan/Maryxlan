## Webdeveloper/Frontend Designer  

I am a webdeveloper and graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science. My passion is to combine unique design with practical usability and solving real-life problems. User experience is also important to me and I have a passion for creating eye-catching and engaging websites. I am also passionate about composing music in my spare time and producing music with Ableton.
